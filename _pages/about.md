I am José Antonio Hernández López, Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Systems at the University of Murcia. Previously, I was a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/sv/ai-autonoma-system-och-mjukvara/) postdoctoral researcher at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/) (Sweden), under the supervision of [Dániel Varró](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Ya6dVoAAAAJ&hl=es). During my PhD, I held an FPU scholarship funded by the University of Murcia, under the supervision of [Jesús Sánchez Cuadrado](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Johd4IEAAAAJ&hl=es). My research focuses on the use of artificial intelligence techniques (specially large language models, LLMs) to improve software engineering processes.

Throughout my research career, I have published in the top conferences and journals in software engineering: ICSE, FSE, ASE, IEEE TSE, MODELS, among others. I have also received best paper awards in several editions of the MODELS conference.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that I have actively collaborated with industry throughout my career. During my PhD, I completed an internship at [InQuery Labs](https://incquery.io/) (a company recently acquired by PTC), where I worked on the development of a transpiler. While working in Sweden, I was affiliated with and participated in several projects at Software Center, a consortium of companies (e.g., Volvo, Bosch, Saab, etc.) and public institutions in the context of Generative AI in Simulation-Based Test Environments. During that period, I also collaborated with Ericsson on the use of LLMs to generate unit tests. Currently, I have a technology transfer contract with the company [accessmedia](https://accessmedia.pro/) to make media content more accessible through the use of LLMs.
